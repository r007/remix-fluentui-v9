# Fluent UI v9 / Remix starter

This is a pretty basic setup, with no frills. It uses the new `vite` compiler and `renderToPipeableStream` approach for server-side rendering. Everything works fine, if you notice any issues, please let me know.

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
